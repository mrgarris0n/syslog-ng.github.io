    These sections describe a method of load balancing logs between multiple
    {{ site.product.short_name }} destinations. The first
    subsection describes the round robin load balancing method based on the
    ${R_MSEC} macro of {{ site.product.short_name }}, while the second subsection describes a
    configuration generator that you can use as an alternative to using the
    example configuration described in the first subsection.
